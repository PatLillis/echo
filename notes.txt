r = # of resources types in the world


Agents
	- Genome
		- has r + 7 genese
		- Tags (3)
			- phenotype
			- visible to other agents
			- Offense Tag
			- Defense Tag
			- Mating Tag
		- Conditions (3)
			- internal behavior
			- Combat Condition
			- Trade Condition
			- Mating Condition
		- Uptake Mask (1)
			- r genese
			- determines agents ability to collect each resource type directly from the environment
		- Trading Resource (1)
			- resource type that the agent will provide to another agent if trading takes place
	- Resource Reservoir
		- Used to pay taxes, produce offspring, and trade
	- Replication
		- Occurs when agent acquires sufficient resources
		- Agent's genome is copied using resources in resoirver
		- Self-Reproduction Threshold
			- used to determine when enough resources have been collected
			- E.g. genome has 3 a's, self-repro thresh. is 2, needs 6 before repro.
		- Self-Reproduction Fraction
			- determines the division of excess resources between original agent and child
			- setting of 1.0 will result in offspring with no internal reserve
			- setting of 0.0 allocates all extra resources to offspring
		- Self-Reproduction Threshold and Self-Reproduction Fraction are defined as constants for the entire world
		- Mutation Probability
			- If mutation occurs in trading-resource gene:
				- agent's trading resource is set to a randomly selected resource
			- If mutation occurs in uptake mask:
				- bits are flipped independently, each according to thsis probability
			- If mutation occurs in tag or coditions:
				- r = # of resource type, n = length of chromosome
				- a number is uniformly selected from [1...n+1].
				- if this number lies in [1...n-1], corresponding allele is set to randomly chosen value (resource type).
				- if this number is n+1, a symbol is added to the end of the chromosome and assigned a random value
				- if this number is n, a number is uniformly selected from [1...r+1]
				- if second number is r+1, last symbol is deleted from the chromosome.
				- otherwise, the last symbol in the gene is set to the corresponding resource


Interactions
	- Between pairs of agents (located at the same site)
		- tested in order (combat, trading, mating)
		- Combat
			- one agent is killed, and its resources are placed in reservoir of survivor
			- Agent A will attack B if A's combat condition is a prefix of B's offense tag
			- Not fully described (see)
		- Trading
			- Must be by mutual agreement
			- Only if A's trading condition is a prefix for B's offense tag
			- Only if B's trading condition is a prefix for A's offense tag
			- Fraction of A's trade resource (above what is needed for mating) is given to B, and vice versa
			- Could be 0, this is a form of "bluffing". Agents which are easily bluffed die sooner
		- Mating
			- Exchange genetic info through recombination
			- match if :
				- A's mating condition is a nonzero prefix of B's mating tag, or
				- both A's mating condition and B's mating tag are zero length
			- 2-point gene crossover
				- 1) select 2 genes to contain crossover points
				- 2) choose crossover points in each gene in each agent
				- 3) cross over in the manner of 2-point crossover
	- Between agents and the environment



Echo Cycle
	- "game loop"
	- 1) Interactions between agents occur at each site
		- "Interaction Parameter" - Proportion of agents that interact at each time step
		- One agent is selected randomly
		- Second agent is then selected in the vicinity of the first
		- First agent moves adjacent to the second in the 1-D array of agents at the site
		- If first agent attacks the second, the second can run away in the array
	- 2) Agents collect resources from the site if any are available
		- Controlled by site parameters
		- distributed as equally as possible among the agents at the site that are able to collect them
	- 3) Each agent at each site is taxed (probabilistically)
		- world-wide probablility
		- If agent does not posess the resources for the tax, it is killed, and its resources are returned to the environment
	- 4) Agents are randomly killed
		- resources returned to the environment
	- 5) Sites produce resources
	- 6) Agents that do not acquire resources migrate to a neighboring site
		- "Acquired" through picking them up, combat, or trade
		- neighboring site is selected at random
	- 7) Agents that can replicate do (asexual reproduction)

Appendix: Echo Parameters
The parameters are described below:
• The number of resource types that will exist in the world.
• The interaction fraction determines the number of agent-agent interactions that
will occur at a site in each Echo cycle. This is determined by multiplying the
interaction fraction by the population at a site. Use of a constant fraction to
determine interaction rates regardless of population size does not accommodate
density-dependent effects, which is an unfortunate oversimplification.
• The trading fraction determines what proportion of an agent’s excess trading
resource it will exchange in a trading interaction with another agent. Trade is
described in Section 2.3.
• The taxation probability is the probability that an agent is taxed in an Echo cycle
(see Section 2.4 for details).
• The neighborhood determines the possible directions of migration between sites.
The three possibilities, given a rectangular array of sites, are none (i.e., no
migration), the four compass points (used in the results described in this article), or
the compass points plus the diagonals.
There are three parameters for each Echo site:
• The mutation probability determines the probability that the genome of an agent is
mutated during self-reproduction. This is a per-gene probability. Mutation is
handled slightly differently for different genes (see Section 2.2).

• The crossover probability is used similarly to a genetic algorithm. It determines the
probability that two agents that mate will be subject to crossover. If crossover is
not performed, the agents are unchanged.
• At the end of an Echo cycle, there is a (typically small) probability of each agent
being killed. This is called the random death probability.
In addition to these parameters, every site must specify four resource-level vectors.
Each of these consists of a vector of non-negative integers whose length is the same as
the number of resource types in the world. These vectors are used as follows:
• The production vector contains the number of resources of each resource type that
will be produced by the site in each Echo cycle.
• The initial vector contains the number of resources of each resource type that will
be present at the site when it is first created.
• The maximum vector contains the maximum level of each resource type that can
accumulate at the site.
• The maintenance vector contains the number of each resource type that will be
charged to an agent when it is taxed.
